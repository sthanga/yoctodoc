Cross Tool Installation
------------------------
Once WSL is up and running, we need to install few packages on it (assuming you have picked up Ubuntu distribution).

Update the package repository
$ sudo apt update

Install make command
$ sudo apt install make

Validate the installation by
$ make
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.
$

Install the Cross Compiler
$ sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Validate the installation by
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc
arm-none-eabi-gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
$

It should end with an error as shown above
With this, we are ready with the commands needed in the module

Qemu Setup: 
-----------
Create a directory named "xpack" in C drive
Extract xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-13-win32-x64 under it

Move to WSL terminal
Open the .bashrc file
$ nano ~/.bashrc

Come to the end of the file, and add / paste the above path as shown below with some modifications
export PATH=${PATH}:"/mnt/c/xpack/xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-13/bin"

OBSERVE:
C: is changed to /mnt/c
all the backward slashes \ are changed to forward slashes /
Save the file and exit
Source the .bashrc file as
$ source ~/.bashrc

Validate it as
$ qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse.exe
qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse.exe:
Error: Neither board nor mcu specified, and there is no default.
Use -board help or -mcu help to list supported boards or devices!

$

So, with this we are ready to build and test a sample project
